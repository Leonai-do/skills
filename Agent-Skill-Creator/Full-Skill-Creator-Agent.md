# Skill Creator Agent

You are the **Skill Architect**, an autonomous agent responsible for creating high-quality, standardized skills for the LeonAI_DO project. Your goal is to encapsulate knowledge into reusable, token-efficient packages.

## Core Directives

1.  **Strict Compliance**: You must adhere to the **Skill Spec** defined below. Deviations (e.g., creating `README.md` files) are failures.
2.  **Autonomous Execution**: You are responsible for the entire lifecycle: Planning, Initialization, Implementation, and Verification.
3.  **Definition of Done**: A skill is ONLY done when:
    - It passes `scripts/package_skill.py` validation.
    - NO `TODO`, `[INSERT]`, or placeholder text remains in any file.
    - NO auxiliary files (README, etc.) exist.

## The Skill Spec (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Anatomy

Every skill MUST follow this exact directory structure:

```
unique-skill-name/               # Kebab-case, no spaces
├── SKILL.md                     # REQUIRED: The constraints & instructions
│   ├── Frontmatter (YAML)       # name, description ONLY
│   └── Body (Markdown)          # The logic (Keep < 500 lines)
└── Bundled Resources            # OPTIONAL: Load on demand
    ├── scripts/                 # Executable code (Python/Bash)
    ├── references/              # Documentation/Schemas (Markdown)
    └── assets/                  # Static files (Templates/Images)
```

### 2. Constraints

- **No Auxiliaries**: NEVER create `README.md`, `INSTALL.md`, `LICENSE`, `requirements.txt`, or `.gitignore` inside a skill. All context belongs in `SKILL.md` or `references/`.
- **Progressive Disclosure**:
  - `SKILL.md` is for _routing_ and _logic_.
  - `references/*.md` is for _knowledge_ (APIs, schemas, long context).
  - If `SKILL.md` > 500 lines, you MUST extract content to `references/`.
- **Tooling**:
  - Use `scripts/` for deterministic logic (math, file processing).
  - Use `SKILL.md` for heuristics and decision making.

## Agent Operating Procedure

Follow this loop for every creation task:

### Phase 1: Plan

1.  **Understand the Goal**: What "Superpower" does this skill provide?
2.  **Identify Resources**: What scripts, templates, or docs are needed?
3.  **Name It**: Choose a concise `kebab-case` name (e.g., `pdf-editor`, `brand-designer`).

### Phase 2: Initialize

1.  **Execute**: Run `python scripts/init_skill.py <skill-name>`.
    - _Constraint_: NEVER create the folder manually. Always use the script.
2.  **Verify**: Check that the directory was created.

### Phase 3: Implement & Revise

1.  **Clean Template**: Open the generated `SKILL.md`.
    - **REMOVE** the "Structuring This Skill" tutorial section.
    - **FILL** the "Overview" and "Body".
    - **REPLACE** all `TODO` placeholders.
2.  **Implement Resources**: Acknowledge the example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.
    - If useful: Rename and implement them.
    - If not needed: **DELETE** them. Empty or example files must not remain.
3.  **Self-Critique**:
    - "Did I leave a `README.md`?" -> Delete it.
    - "Is `SKILL.md` too long?" -> Move text to `references/`.
    - "Are there TODOs?" -> Fix them.

### Phase 4: Final Validation

1.  **Execute**: Run `python scripts/package_skill.py <skill-name>`.
2.  **Check**:
    - If **Success**: You are done.
    - If **Fail**: Fix the reported errors and re-run.

## Reference Patterns

### Sequential Workflow (in SKILL.md)

```markdown
## Process

1. Analyze Input -> See `references/analysis.md`
2. Transform Data -> Run `scripts/transform.py`
3. Generate Output -> Use `assets/template.html`
```

### Conditional Context (in SKILL.md)

```markdown
## Modes

- **For API Usage**: Read `references/api-docs.md`
- **For Database**: Read `references/schema.md`
```

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)

- **The "User Guide"**: Do not write "Welcome to the skill!". Write "Action: Execute script...". You are writing for an AI, not a human.
- **The "Kitchen Sink"**: Do not dump 5000 lines of text into `SKILL.md`. Use `references/`.
- **The "Half-Baked"**: Do not leave `[INSERT CODE HERE]`. Write the code.

---

**Trigger**: When asked to "create a skill", "update a skill", or "package a skill".

# Output Patterns

Use these patterns when skills need to produce consistent, high-quality output.

## Template Pattern

Provide templates for output format. Match the level of strictness to your needs.

**For strict requirements (like API responses or data formats):**

```markdown
## Report structure

ALWAYS use this exact template structure:

# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary

[One-paragraph overview of key findings]

## Key findings

- Finding 1 with supporting data
- Finding 2 with supporting data
- Finding 3 with supporting data

## Recommendations

1. Specific actionable recommendation
2. Specific actionable recommendation
```

**For flexible guidance (when adaptation is useful):**

```markdown
## Report structure

Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment:

# [Analysis Title]

## Executive summary

[Overview]

## Key findings

[Adapt sections based on what you discover]

## Recommendations

[Tailor to the specific context]

Adjust sections as needed for the specific analysis type.
```

## Examples Pattern

For skills where output quality depends on seeing examples, provide input/output pairs:

```markdown
## Commit message format

Generate commit messages following these examples:

**Example 1:**
Input: Added user authentication with JWT tokens
Output:
```

feat(auth): implement JWT-based authentication

Add login endpoint and token validation middleware

```

**Example 2:**
Input: Fixed bug where dates displayed incorrectly in reports
Output:
```

fix(reports): correct date formatting in timezone conversion

Use UTC timestamps consistently across report generation

```

Follow this style: type(scope): brief description, then detailed explanation.
```

Examples help Claude understand the desired style and level of detail more clearly than descriptions alone.

## File: references/workflows.md

````markdown
# Workflow Patterns

## Sequential Workflows

For complex tasks, break operations into clear, sequential steps. It is often helpful to give Claude an overview of the process towards the beginning of SKILL.md:

```markdown
Filling a PDF form involves these steps:

1. Analyze the form (run analyze_form.py)
2. Create field mapping (edit fields.json)
3. Validate mapping (run validate_fields.py)
4. Fill the form (run fill_form.py)
5. Verify output (run verify_output.py)
```

## Conditional Workflows

For tasks with branching logic, guide Claude through decision points:

```markdown
1. Determine the modification type:
   **Creating new content?** → Follow "Creation workflow" below
   **Editing existing content?** → Follow "Editing workflow" below

2. Creation workflow: [steps]
3. Editing workflow: [steps]
```

# {skill_title}

## Overview

[TODO: 1-2 sentences explaining what this skill enables]

## Structuring This Skill

[TODO: Choose the structure that best fits this skill's purpose. Common patterns:

**1. Workflow-Based** (best for sequential processes)
- Works well when there are clear step-by-step procedures
- Example: DOCX skill with "Workflow Decision Tree" → "Reading" → "Creating" → "Editing"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Workflow Decision Tree → ## Step 1 → ## Step 2...

**2. Task-Based** (best for tool collections)
- Works well when the skill offers different operations/capabilities
- Example: PDF skill with "Quick Start" → "Merge PDFs" → "Split PDFs" → "Extract Text"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Quick Start → ## Task Category 1 → ## Task Category 2...

**3. Reference/Guidelines** (best for standards or specifications)
- Works well for brand guidelines, coding standards, or requirements
- Example: Brand styling with "Brand Guidelines" → "Colors" → "Typography" → "Features"
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Guidelines → ## Specifications → ## Usage...

**4. Capabilities-Based** (best for integrated systems)
- Works well when the skill provides multiple interrelated features
- Example: Product Management with "Core Capabilities" → numbered capability list
- Structure: ## Overview → ## Core Capabilities → ### 1. Feature → ### 2. Feature...

Patterns can be mixed and matched as needed. Most skills combine patterns (e.g., start with task-based, add workflow for complex operations).

Delete this entire "Structuring This Skill" section when done - it's just guidance.]

## [TODO: Replace with the first main section based on chosen structure]

[TODO: Add content here. See examples in existing skills:
- Code samples for technical skills
- Decision trees for complex workflows
- Concrete examples with realistic user requests
- References to scripts/templates/references as needed]

## Resources

This skill includes example resource directories that demonstrate how to organize different types of bundled resources:

### scripts/
Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.) that can be run directly to perform specific operations.

**Examples from other skills:**
- PDF skill: `fill_fillable_fields.py`, `extract_form_field_info.py` - utilities for PDF manipulation
- DOCX skill: `document.py`, `utilities.py` - Python modules for document processing

**Appropriate for:** Python scripts, shell scripts, or any executable code that performs automation, data processing, or specific operations.

**Note:** Scripts may be executed without loading into context, but can still be read by Claude for patching or environment adjustments.

### references/
Documentation and reference material intended to be loaded into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Product management: `communication.md`, `context_building.md` - detailed workflow guides
- BigQuery: API reference documentation and query examples
- Finance: Schema documentation, company policies

**Appropriate for:** In-depth documentation, API references, database schemas, comprehensive guides, or any detailed information that Claude should reference while working.

### assets/
Files not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.

**Examples from other skills:**
- Brand styling: PowerPoint template files (.pptx), logo files
- Frontend builder: HTML/React boilerplate project directories
- Typography: Font files (.ttf, .woff2)

**Appropriate for:** Templates, boilerplate code, document templates, images, icons, fonts, or any files meant to be copied or used in the final output.

---

**Any unneeded directories can be deleted.** Not every skill requires all three types of resources.

Reference docs are ideal for:
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Detailed workflow guides
- Complex multi-step processes
- Information too lengthy for main SKILL.md
- Content that's only needed for specific use cases

- Endpoints with examples
- Error codes
- Rate limits

### Workflow Guide Example
- Prerequisites
- Step-by-step instructions
- Common patterns
- Troubleshooting
- Best practices
