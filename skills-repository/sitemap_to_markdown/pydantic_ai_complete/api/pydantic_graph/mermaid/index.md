The background color of the diagram.

If None, the default transparent background is used. The color value is interpreted as a hexadecimal color code by default (and should not have a leading '#'), but you can also use named colors by prefixing the value with `'!'`. For example, valid choices include `background_color='!white'` or `background_color='FF0000'`.
