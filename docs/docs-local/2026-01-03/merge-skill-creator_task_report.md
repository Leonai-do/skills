# Task Report: Merge feat/formalize-skill-creator into main

## Initial Project State

- Branch: `feat/formalize-skill-creator`
- Target Branch: `main`
- `main` contained recently added `sitemap_to_markdown` skill and reports.

## Constraint Compliance

- **Rule**: "Don't remove anything from main, add or replace, not remove."
- **Execution**:
  - Identified that the branch was missing two files present in `main`: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md`.
  - Merged `main` into the branch first to ensure no regressions.
  - Merged the branch into `main`.
  - Explicitly restored the missing files from the pre-merge state of `main`.
  - Verified all newly created skills and reports remain intact.

## Changes Made

- Merged the formalized skill creator infrastructure into `main`.
- Restored `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
- Restored `skills/skill-creator/SKILL.md`.
- Synchronized `main` to `guardian-state`.
- All changes pushed to remote origin.

## Summary of Results

- The repository now features the formal `skill_factory.py` tool.
- All specialized skills are now organized within `skills-repository/`.
- No documentation or established skills were removed.
- `guardian-state` is updated as a stable backup.
